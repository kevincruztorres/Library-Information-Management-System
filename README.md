# Library-Information-Management-System

## Description
An application that manages a small library with a collection of books using ArrayList. Information about a book includes ISBN, title, author, publisher, and publishing year. The catalog of books and the information of each book are stored in a text file before and after the program is executed.

Upon exiting, the program saves the book catalog back to the file if any change (including adding, removing, updating, and sorting) has been made.
